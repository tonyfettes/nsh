# `nsh`

[WIP] An attempt to an autocompleted shell.

**This project is under actively development and in its primary stage,
and not yet usable.**

`nsh` tries to provide a plugin interface by IPC or shared library, so
completion could be achieved in an asynchronous way that would not block
user input.

## Roadmap

- [ ] POSIX shell parser
- [ ] Non interactive execution
- [ ] Interactive execution
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Line editor
